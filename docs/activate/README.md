Most retail licenses are linked to a Microsoft account.

### Volume licenses

Volume licenses can be activated using a key, or using KMS.

- Multiple Activation Key has a maximum number of activations, you can use and activate Office multiple times.
- Key Management Service activation requires the use of GVLK and the setup of a KMS host.
