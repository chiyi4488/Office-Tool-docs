## Office Tool Plus console helper

Office Tool Plus.Console is a command line program. By default, when executing a command through Office Tool Plus, the CMD will return immediately and will not wait for Office Tool Plus to exit. Office Tool Plus.Console will wait for the program to exit and supports outputting the log when executing commands.

Here is a example to enable logging output for Office Tool Plus:

``` batch
"Office Tool Plus.Console" /enableLog
```

::: tip Tip
The *deploy* and *ospp* commands enable logging by default, you do not need to specify the /enableLog parameter again. *deploy* and *ospp* commands cannot be mixed with other commands, or they will not be recognized.
:::

If you want to run *deploy* or *ospp* commands, specify the command like that:

``` batch
"Office Tool Plus.Console" deploy /addProduct ...
```

You can run *deploy* commands first, then *ospp* commands. The Office will be installed and activated automated.
